# About Me

Hey! You can call me ***Tony***. I'm an ***entrepreneurial spirit*** with a brain wired for tech and building software. My journey in technology didn't start with a degree or a corporate training program; it started in my youth with a genuine curiosity for how things work and a drive to solve problems. Before I even graduated high school, I had founded my first IT support company, ***GBHTech***, diving headfirst into managing servers, fixing computers, and helping people make sense of their technology.

For over a decade, I've been on a mission to ***build useful stuff***. This path has led me on quite the journey. From founding multiple startups like ***Automately Cloud*** and ***Dusty Beetles*** to contributing to major platforms at companies like ***Ebates (now Rakuten)***, where I played a part in developing the technology that contributed to a ***billion-dollar acquisition***.

## My Philosophy

I see technology as a set of tools for ***creativity*** and ***problem-solving***. Whether I'm building a distributed backend platform to handle thousands of transactions, streamlining a company's workflow with custom automation scripts, or diving into the world of ***AI*** and large language models, my goal is the same: to ***build stuff that works well and makes a real impact***.

My approach is ***just make it happen***. I'm just as comfortable wiring a network rack or managing ***VMWare infrastructure*** as I am developing a full-stack application with modern frameworks like ***React*** and ***NestJS***.

## My Entrepreneurial Spirit

If you look at my history, you'll see a recurring theme: ***make stuff happen***. From e-commerce stores to security solutions, I'm drawn to the challenge of turning an idea into a reality. This ***entrepreneurial spirit*** has taught me to be adaptable, to learn quickly, and to wear many hatsâ€”***developer, project manager, business strategist, and customer support specialist***, sometimes all in the same day.
