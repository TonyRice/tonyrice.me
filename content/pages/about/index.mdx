# About Me

Hello! I'm Tony Rice, an IT professional, software engineer, and lifelong tinkerer based in Beloit, Wisconsin. My journey in technology didn't start with a degree or a corporate training program; it started in my teens with a genuine curiosity for how things work and a drive to solve problems. Before I even graduated high school, I had founded my first IT support company, GBHTech, diving headfirst into managing servers, fixing computers, and helping people make sense of their technology.

That early experience of building something from scratch ignited a passion that has defined my career. For over a decade, I've been on a mission to build useful, innovative, and robust solutions. This path has led me through a variety of roles—from founding multiple startups like Automately Cloud and Dusty Beetles to contributing to major platforms at companies like Ebates (now Rakuten), where I played a part in developing the technology that contributed to a billion-dollar acquisition.

## My Philosophy

I see technology as a set of tools for creativity and problem-solving. Whether I'm architecting a distributed backend platform to handle thousands of transactions, streamlining a company's workflow with custom automation scripts, or diving into the world of AI and large language models, my goal is the same: to build things that work well and make a real impact.

My approach is hands-on and holistic. I'm just as comfortable wiring a network rack or managing VMWare infrastructure as I am developing a full-stack application with modern frameworks like React and NestJS. I believe having a deep understanding of the entire stack, from the physical layer up to the user interface, is crucial for creating truly effective and resilient systems.

## The Entrepreneurial Bug

If you look at my history, you'll see a recurring theme: starting things. From e-commerce stores to security solutions, I'm drawn to the challenge of turning an idea into a reality. This entrepreneurial spirit has taught me to be adaptable, to learn quickly, and to wear many hats—developer, project manager, business strategist, and customer support specialist, sometimes all in the same day.

Thanks for stopping by to learn a little more about me. Feel free to explore my projects or get in touch!
